## Technologies Used
- Kotlin: The primary programming language used for developing the CodeFriend Android application. Kotlin is a modern, concise, and expressive language that integrates seamlessly with existing Java codebases.

- MVVM Architecture: CodeFriend follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which promotes the separation of concerns and facilitates the testability and maintainability of the codebase. The ViewModel components store and manage UI-related data, ensuring a clean separation between the UI and the business logic.

- Dagger Hilt: Dagger Hilt is a dependency injection framework for Android applications. CodeFriend utilizes Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, enabling more efficient and scalable development by managing object creation and providing dependencies to various application components.

- OpenAI: CodeFriend leverages the power of OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to provide an intelligent chatbot that assists users in solving coding doubts and analyzing multiple algorithms. OpenAI's models enable the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

- Cloud Messaging: CodeFriend utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications to users' devices. Cloud Messaging enables targeted and personalized messages, allowing users to stay connected and receive critical updates even when the application is not in use.
